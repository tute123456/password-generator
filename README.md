# password-generator

Hello, this is my first project...

What I want to achieve is that the password that it generates has a specific order, which is as follows
One capital letter
2 - Lower Case Letter
3 - Lower Case Letter
4 - Asterisk (special character)
5 - Number
6 - Number
7 - Number
8 - Lower Case Letter
