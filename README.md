# password-generator

Hello, this is my first project...

What I want to achieve is that the password that it generates has a specific order, which is as follows
1 - capital letter
2 - Lower Case Letter
3 - Lower Case Letter
4 - Asterisk (special character)
5 - Number
6 - Number
7 - Number
8 - Lower Case Letter

## Example

Mto*872e

## Final Message

and I would also like that once the "generate" button is pressed, a message appears below saying "Your password was created successfully and you can now paste it!"

## files

clave.ps1 # Original

password.ps1 # test with character sequence order (inside test folder)

powershell.exe #executable powershell file with code and hidden cmd popup
